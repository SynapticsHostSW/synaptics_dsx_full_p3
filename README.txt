The following files are provided in this tarball.

drivers/input/touchscreen/synaptics_dsx_i2c.[ch]
   The source code of the Synaptics DSX main driver containing support for
   2D touch, 0D buttons, and proximity.

drivers/input/touchscreen/synaptics_dsx_rmi_dev.c
   The source code of the RMI Dev module used for direct register access from
   user space programs via a character device node or sysfs entries.

drivers/input/touchscreen/synaptics_dsx_fw_update.c
   The source code of the firmware update module used for carrying out both
   in-system and command-line reflash.

drivers/input/touchscreen/synaptics_dsx_test_reporting.c
   The source code of the test reporting module used for accessing analog
   diagnostic and control functions and reading production test reports.

drivers/input/touchscreen/Kconfig_panda
   Example Kconfig for the OMAP Panda Board.
drivers/input/touchscreen/Kconfig_beagle
   Example Kconfig for the OMAP Beagle Board.

drivers/input/touchscreen/Makefile_panda
   Example Makefile for the OMAP Panda Board.
drivers/input/touchscreen/Makefile_beagle
   Example Makefile for the OMAP Beagle Board.

firmware/Makefile
   Example Makefile for the OMAP Panda Board for the inclusion of the firmware
   image in the kernel build for doing reflash during device initialization.

include/linux/input/synaptics_dsx.h
   The Synaptics DSX header file shared between the device and the driver.

arch/arm/configs/panda_defconfig
   Example defconfig for the OMAP Panda Board.
arch/arm/configs/omap3_beagle_android_defconfig
   Example defconfig for the OMAP Beagle Board.

arch/arm/mach-omap2/board-omap4panda.c
   Example board file for the OMAP Panda Board.
arch/arm/mach-omap2/board-omap3beagle.c
   Example board file for the OMAP Beagle Board.



HOW TO INSTALL THE DRIVER
-------------------------

** Copy the .c and .h souce code files in drivers/input/touchscreen to the
   equivalent directory in your kernel tree.

** Copy synaptics_dsx.h in include/linux/input to the equivalent directory
   in your kernel tree.

** Update Makefile and Kconfig in your kernel tree's drivers/input/touchscreen
   directory to include support for building the Synaptics DSX driver. Use the
   equivalent files in the tarball as examples.

** Update your defconfig by referring to the defconfigs in the tarball as
   examples.

** Update your board file by referring to the board files in the tarball as
   examples.

** "make clean" your kernel.

** "make" your defconfig.

** Rebuild your kernel.

** Install the new kernel on your Android system.

** Reboot your Android system.



HOW TO INCLUDE FIRMWARE IMAGE IN KERNEL BUILD FOR DOING REFLASH
---------------------------------------------------------------

** Convert the .img image file to the .ihex format using the command below.
   objcopy -I binary -O ihex <firmware_name>.img startup_fw_update.img.ihex

** Place startup_fw_update.img.ihex in the firmware/synaptics directory in your
   kernel tree.

** Include the line below in firmware/Makefile (this line is commented out by
   default in the example Makefile in the driver).
   fw-shipped-$(CONFIG_TOUCHSCREEN_SYNAPTICS_DSX_FW_UPDATE) += synaptics/startup_fw_update.img

** Rebuild your kernel.
